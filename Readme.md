CV_TempleRun is an innovative project that leverages computer vision and hand gesture recognition to interact with a Temple Run-style video game. Using your webcam, you can control the game through intuitive hand gestures detected in real time!

---

## 📖 Introduction

CV_TempleRun demonstrates how computer vision and gesture recognition can be used for hands-free interaction with games. Powered by [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/), and [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/), this project captures hand movements via your webcam and translates them into keyboard commands to play Temple Run or similar endless runner games.  
This is a fun way to explore gesture recognition, automation, and computer vision in Python!

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/subiksh0515/CV_TempleRun.git
    cd CV_TempleRun
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    If `requirements.txt` is not provided, install manually:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
    ```

3. **(Optional) Check your webcam**
    Ensure your webcam is connected and accessible.

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Run the script**
    ```bash
    python "CV VideoGame.py"
    ```

2. **Open Temple Run (or any endless runner game) on your PC**

3. **Control the game with your hand gestures!**
    - Raise your hand or perform specific gestures (as defined in the script) to simulate keyboard inputs for actions like jump, slide, or turn.
    - The webcam window will display the detected hand and visual feedback.

> **Note:** Ensure the game window is in focus for PyAutoGUI to send keyboard events.
